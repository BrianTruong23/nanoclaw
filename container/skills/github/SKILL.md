# GitHub and Git

Use this skill when the user asks to check repository state, inspect remotes, commit work, or push to GitHub.

## Commands You Can Run

```bash
github status
github whoami
git clone <repository_url>
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git diff
git log --oneline -5
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git checkout <branch>
git stash
git merge <branch>
git rebase <branch>
git revert <commit_hash>
github push
github push <branch>
```

## Workflow

1. Run `github status` before changing Git state.
2. If the user asks to push existing committed work, run `github push`.
3. If the user asks to commit and push, inspect `git status --short --branch`, then commit only relevant files, then push.
4. Keep the user informed if the workspace is not a Git repository, has no GitHub token, or the project mount is read-only.

## Safety

- Do not run destructive commands such as `git reset`, `git clean`, `git rm`, or force pushes.
- Do not print tokens.
- If code edits are required, use the coding agent flow instead of trying to hand-edit large changes from chat.
